# identify_customer_segments

The goal of this project is to use data provided by AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions in order to identify relationships between demographics features, and understand these relationships in the context of customer segments. To do so, we used clustering techniques and principal component analysis. The implementation is included in the Jupyter notebook provided.
